        <h1>Who are Stonewall?</h1>
        <p>In the 1950s and 60s, very few places welcomed gay people, but those that did
            were often bars. One of these was <b>The Stonewall Inn</b>, a pub which catered
            to a wide assortment of patrons, inluding drag queens, transgender people, and 
            homeless youth. In the 1960s, raids on gay bars were routine, but whe they raided
            The Stonewall Inn they quickly lost control of the situation, leading to <b>The
            Stonewall Riots</b>. These were a series of protests which led the charge on
            earning the first LGBTQ+ rights in America and later, other places like the UK.
            <br><br>
            Today, Stonewall is a charity which continues to fight for LGBTQ+ rights by
            providing support and guidance on LGBTQ+ inclusion, "working on a world where
            we're all free to be".
