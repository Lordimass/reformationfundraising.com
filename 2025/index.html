            <h1>Events</h1>
            <i>Start times are estimated, they may be slightly different!</i>
            <p>
                <br>
                At <b>5:40am</b> we will begin the <b>20 minute countdown</b> to the beginning of the event, during this time you can find which streamer you want to watch from the members page and get ready to watch.
                <br><br>
                The stream begins at <b>6:00am</b> with the launch of a <b>brand new Minecraft server</b>, this year with a <i>special twist</i>. This is just the launch and we’ll play on it throughout the server, so don’t worry if you can’t catch the launch, plus, there’s always the VOD!
                <br><br>
                At <b>12pm</b> CosmosFreckles is DMing a <b>D&D One-shot</b>, you can join in with this too by influencing our decisions through Twitch chat.
                <br><br>
                At <b>5pm</b> we will begin the <b>party games</b>, this is usually the most popular time for our streams because everyone can join in and play games such as Jackbox and Crab Game. Tune in at any point during this time to come play with us. But be warned, this segment is not appropriate for children!
                <br><br>

                <br><br>
                At <b>2am</b> we’ll be playing <b>low effort games</b> to pass the time and keep us awake, this part of the stream is the hardest bit because we’ll all be tired, and silly games are good for keeping the energy up.
                <br><br>
                The stream ends at <b>6am</b>. We’ll recap everything that happened during the stream and meet back up in one voice channel to say our thanks to everyone who donated. And thanks to you for watching!</p>

        <h1>Who are Stonewall?</h1>
        <p>In the 1950s and 60s, very few places welcomed gay people, but those that did
            were often bars. One of these was <b>The Stonewall Inn</b>, a pub which catered
            to a wide assortment of patrons, inluding drag queens, transgender people, and 
            homeless youth. In the 1960s, raids on gay bars were routine, but whe they raided
            The Stonewall Inn they quickly lost control of the situation, leading to <b>The
            Stonewall Riots</b>. These were a series of protests which led the charge on
            earning the first LGBTQ+ rights in America and later, other places like the UK.
            <br><br>
            Today, Stonewall is a charity which continues to fight for LGBTQ+ rights by
            providing support and guidance on LGBTQ+ inclusion, "working on a world where
            we're all free to be".
