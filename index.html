            <p>Hi! We are a group of friends who host a yearly 24hr Charity Livestream to raise money for the areas of the world and groups of people who need it the most. We hope to make a difference in the world, even if only a little bit.</p>
            <p>The last stream was on 11th February 2024, and the next one isn’t until February 2025, so it’s quiet here for now…</p>
            <p>While you wait for next year’s stream, check out the archive of previous events or go to the members page to see the team’s social media pages.</p>
